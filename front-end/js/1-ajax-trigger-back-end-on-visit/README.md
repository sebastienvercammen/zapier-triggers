# Trigger a back-end in the background on a webpage's visit

This method calls one of the [back-end examples](../../../back-end) (for web, so not [shell](../../../back-end/shell)) in the background when you get a visit on a webpage (using JavaScript + [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started)).

**We use the newer [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch), so make sure to [check browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API#Browser_compatibility).** If you need better browser compatibility, submit a [GitHub Issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) with your request.
