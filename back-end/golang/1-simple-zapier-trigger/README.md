# Trigger a simple Zapier webhook

## Running the script on a webpage visit

You have two options:
1. Set up an existing web server to run Go code.
2. Run your own web server (or framework) in Go (e.g. fasthttp) and implement the example code. _(recommended)_

## Running the script from a command line

1. Make sure you're in the right folder w/ your command line.
2. Make sure the `go` command is accessible from the command line.
3. Run the script: `go run trigger.go`
