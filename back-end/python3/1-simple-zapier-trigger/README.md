# Trigger a simple Zapier webhook

## Running the script on a webpage visit

You have two options:
1. Set up an existing web server to run Python code.
2. Run your own web server (or framework) in Python (e.g. WSGI, Django, Flask, aiohttp, Tornado) and implement the example code. _(recommended)_

## Running the script from a command line

1. Make sure you're in the right folder w/ your command line.
2. Make sure the `python` command is accessible from the command line.
3. Ensure you're using Python 3.x: `python -V`
4. Run the script: `python trigger.py`
